- Timestamp recording of all operations
- Selectable and copyable log content
- One-click clear history

## Usage

### Running the Application
```bash
# Execute in project root directory
./gradlew :kadb-test-app:run

# Or build executable file
./gradlew :kadb-test-app:createDistributable
```

### Connecting to Emulator
1. Start Android emulator
2. Keep default settings in the application:
   - Host address: `localhost`
   - Port: `5555`
3. Click "Test Connection" button

### Connecting to Real Device (TCP/IP)
1. Enable "Wireless debugging" on device (Android 11+)
2. Get device IP address and port
3. Enter corresponding host address and port in application
4. Click "Test Connection"

### Device Pairing Process
1. Go to "Developer options" ‚Üí "Wireless debugging" on Android device
2. Click "Pair device with pairing code"
3. Record displayed IP address, port, and pairing code
4. Fill in corresponding information in application
5. Click "Start Pairing"

### Common Test Commands
```bash
# Get device information
getprop ro.build.version.release

# List installed applications
pm list packages

# Get device model
getprop ro.product.model

# View memory usage
cat /proc/meminfo

# Get CPU information
cat /proc/cpuinfo

# List running processes
ps

# View network connections
netstat

# Get screen resolution
wm size
```

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Failed
- Ensure device is on the same network
- Check firewall settings
- Verify ADB debugging is enabled
- Try restarting ADB service

### Pairing Failed
- Ensure using correct pairing code
- Check network connection
- Pairing code has time limit, regenerate if expired
- Some devices may require confirming pairing request

### Known Issues
- **Device Pairing**: Currently not available on JVM target, we are working to resolve this issue

### Command Execution Failed
- Check if command syntax is correct
- Some commands may require root permissions
- System restrictions may block certain operations
